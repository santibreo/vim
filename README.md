# NeoVim configuration

I suffer a lot until I reach this situation, now I feel like I am able to edit files as fast as I should. You must now that I am currently using this program just to edit `.tex` files for `\Latex` documentation, write python code and manage git repositories. But it is easy to extend its funcionalities.

# TODOS

- [ ] Better terminal integration (send code line and visual selection).
- [ ] Support for markdown and Rmarkdown files.
